1.**Donation Progress Tracking**:
Implement a feature that allows users to track the progress of their donations.
When users make a donation, display a progress bar or indicator that shows how close they are to reaching the donation goal.
Provide clear visual feedback on the status of each donation, such as "Incomplete," "In Progress," or "Completed."
Users can easily see how much more is needed to fully fund a donation item.

2. **Interactive Data Visualization**:
   - Enhance the statistics page by incorporating interactive data visualization for a better user experience.
   - Consider using charting libraries like Chart.js or D3.js to create visually appealing and interactive charts.
   - Display additional insights or breakdowns of donation data, such as a bar chart showing donation amounts per category.

3. **Real-Time Notifications**:
   - Implement real-time notifications to keep users informed about donation-related activities.
   - Notify users when they successfully make a donation or when there are updates to their donations.
   - Use technologies like WebSockets or server-sent events (SSE) to enable real-time communication between the server and the client.
